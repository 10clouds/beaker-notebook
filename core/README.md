#Beaker notebook
##Overview

Beaker is a polyglot code notebook that allows data scientists to analyze data and document their process using multiple programming languages. Users can seamlessly switch between their favorite languages and tools within a single document. Current language support includes Python, Groovy, R, Scala, Matlab, HTML, Markdown, and Latex. Results can be rendered as interactive visualizations that can easily be shared with colleagues or the public.

##Polyglot literate programming

Imagine a classic lab notebook. The flexibility it provides is endless. You can write words, do math, draw sketches, paint pictures, tape in photographs, or anything else you can imagine. What's more, you can mix these different media however you want. A single page can have English, German, calculus, chemistry, and a picture of your cat.
Beaker provides the same flexibility with code. You can switch seamlessly between many different markup and programming languages within a single document. We've built in support for many languages, and if you want something we haven't gotten to yet, you can add it yourself by writing a plugin.

##Sharing your progress

Returning to our paper-based notebook, when you have something to share with your colleagues, there are many options: take the notebook to their desks, mail them a carbon copy of relevant pages, or hang pages on a bulletin board.
Beaker gives you all this flexibility and more. You can take a snapshot of your work at any time and easily share it with the world. Whether you want to share a block of code, a chart, one section of a notebook, or a whole document, you're one click away from publishing a snapshot that anybody can view in a browser, even if they don't use Beaker themselves.

##Publication and reproducible science

Here is where Beaker blows past what's possible on paper. Traditionally, there are many steps between exploratory work and publication. Notes will be spread across many pages or even different notebooks, data might be somewhere completely different, and drafts of figures could be on whiteboards or napkins. Eventually all of this work is summarized into a document with only text and figures. The reviewers and readers never get to see the full process or data.
Beaker changes all of that. With its polyglot nature, hierarchical section format, and ability to show or hide any cells you want, you can record your full process in a single document. Once you're done with exploration, start a new section with facts and figures. When you're ready to publish, you can collapse the data and details, expand your writeup, and send off the document. The viewers can choose how deeply to examine your work. A casual reader may just look at the writeup, but anybody who's interested can dig into your process and code with the ability to completely reproduce your work.

##Open Source Software

Beaker was built as an internal Two Sigma project but is now being released to the public under the Apache 2.0 license. Is currently available to contributors via a private GitHub repo and will be made public in the near future.
