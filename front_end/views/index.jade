      ## Overview

      Notebook-style development provides a more exploratory way to write code than with traditional IDEs. Notebook interfaces are comprised of a series of code blocks, called cells, which can stand alone or act in unison. The development process is one of discovery, where a developer experiments in one cell, then can continue to write code in a subsequent cell depending on results from the first. Particularly when analyzing large datasets, this conversational approach allows researchers to quickly discover patterns or other artifacts of the data.
