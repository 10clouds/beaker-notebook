So far, the electron launcher can be used by running the following command:

```sh
electron ./launcher/electron
```

Electron pre-built binaries can be installed by running

```sh
npm install electron-prebuilt -g
```

Note that the server is not executed by this command, so you must start it through
other means (`gradle run` for developers).
