Bunsen API Server
==========

The API serves dynamic data to requests generated by the end user browser.
Primarily, this is through interacting with pages served by [Web](web.md).

### Dependencies:

* [Postgres](postgres.md) serves as the primary persistent data store.
* [Elasticsearch](elasticsearch.md) serves API's queries for the marketplace data.
* [Provisioner](provisioner.md) provides a [Beaker](beaker.md) when API asks for one.

Supports:

* [Web](web.md) initiates AJAX requests to the API's exposed endpoints


### Migrations

API is only service that connects to Postgres.  Thus, postgres migrations are
launched via running a script in the API.

To create a migration, you can

* Build the API image (see [README](../../README.md))
* Find the api image's id
* `docker run -v /vagrant/app:/var/app [api-container-id] --new-migration=migration_name`
