# Beaker Service

Beaker service provides both the front end and back end of the actual Beaker
Notebook interface.

Beaker essentially provides an alternate version of the [Beaker-notebook](http://beakernotebook.com/) project,
with modifications that make it suitable for running inside Bunsen (and
unsusable in a desktop context).
